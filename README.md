## Architecture
The "Marvel" platform is structured into two main components: Firebase and AI. The Firebase side, detailed in this repository, encompasses both the frontend, developed with NextJS and hosted on Firebase Hosting, and the backend, which includes user management and session handling via Firebase Functions like `signUpUser` and `createChatSession`. The `communicator` and `toolCommunicator` functions act as proxies, facilitating interaction between the Firebase infrastructure and the AI services, ensuring seamless data flow and integration. Firestore DB is utilized for data storage. The AI components, housed in a separate repository, include a chatbot and tools like "Quizify" and "YouTube Flashcard Generator."

  Houses the Firebase Functions, which are serverless functions responsible for backend processes such as AI chatbot and tools communicators

## Key Files
- **`firebase.json`**:
  Contains configuration settings for Firebase services such as hosting and rules.

- **`firestore.indexes.json`**:
  Manages custom indexing for Firestore to optimize query performance.

- **`firestore.rules`**:
  Security rules for Firestore database, defining read/write permissions.

- **`package.json`** & **`package-lock.json`**:
  Defines the projectâ€™s global dependencies
